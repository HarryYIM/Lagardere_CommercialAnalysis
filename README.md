# Lagardere_CommercialAnalysis
Models for Commercial Analysis

1. Out of Stock model
Method of using local file. Need to link to DB with Relational Schema

2. Relational DataBase building
The advantage of using a relational schema in Lagardere:
- We can save and link our `analysis table over time` (Including such as out of stock check, rank analysis, price analysis).
- User-Friendly: `Visualization` anything by linking Database directly to dashboard.
- `Faster` to query/get data from TM1 since now we need much smaller table. And only few of them need to update frequently.
