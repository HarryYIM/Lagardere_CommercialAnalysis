### Inventory Optimization
Working on pyspark.
#### Motivation:
From one side, we want to avoid costly shortages, on the other hand, Inventory consumes space, gets damaged, and sometimes becomes obsolete â€” and carrying surplus inventory costs the organization. Simply, optimizing inventory means finding the perfect balance between demand and supply including `facing`, and `capacity`.
